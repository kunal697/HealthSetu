## Problem Statement

Theme : Healthcare

Problem statement : Healthcare institutions require efficient systems to manage patient care, doctor schedules, and administrative tasks. Implementing role-based dashboards for patients, doctors, and administrators can streamline workflows and improve communication. A smart queuing system for doctor-patient appointments ensures efficient scheduling, reducing waiting times. Additionally, inventory management is crucial for maintaining adequate stock levels of medical supplies, while automated medicine reminders enhance patient adherence to prescribed treatments. The objective is to design an integrated healthcare management system that optimizes hospital operations and enhances patient care.
