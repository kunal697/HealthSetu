Problem statement title : Design and Implementation of an Integrated Healthcare Management System for Efficient Patient Care and Hospital Operations

Problem statement : Healthcare institutions require efficient systems to manage patient care, doctor schedules, and administrative tasks. Implementing role-based dashboards for patients, doctors, and administrators can streamline workflows and improve communication. A smart queuing system for doctor-patient appointments ensures efficient scheduling, reducing waiting times. Additionally, inventory management is crucial for maintaining adequate stock levels of medical supplies, while automated medicine reminders enhance patient adherence to prescribed treatments. The objective is to design an integrated healthcare management system that optimizes hospital operations and enhances patient care.

## How We Solve the Problem
1. Patients can book appointments using an AI voice assistant, track real-time health data, and receive automated medicine reminders for timely adherence.
2. Doctors gain access to patient records, manage appointments, and monitor real-time health data for better diagnosis and treatment.
3. Admins oversee doctor-patient assignments, manage hospital inventory (add, update, delete stock), and ensure optimal resource allocation.
4. A smart queuing system optimizes doctor-patient scheduling, reducing waiting times and enhancing efficiency.
5. Automated workflows improve communication between patients, doctors, and administrators, ensuring seamless hospital operations.
6. AI-driven insights help in early diagnosis, better treatment plans, and overall healthcare optimization.
